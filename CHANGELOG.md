# Changelog

All notable changes to Rails Table Preferences will be documented in this file.

The format is based on a lightweight Keep a Changelog style, and this project currently follows early pre-1.0 semantic versioning.

## [Unreleased]

Until v0.1.0 is tagged, the detailed entries in this section are the temporary source for the initial release contents. In the release-prep or tag PR, move the landed entries into `[0.1.0] - YYYY-MM-DD`, leave a fresh empty `[Unreleased]` section for post-release work, and keep open pull requests or proposal issues out of the dated release entry until they land.

### Release highlights

- Table preference persistence and preset resolution cover owner, shared, role, and organization scopes for dense business index screens.
- Resource table helpers, column metadata, fixed/pinned columns, column groups, renderer registries, and data-attribute boundaries provide convention-first table integration without taking over host-app presentation.
- Filter, sort, controller params, Ransack, hidden-field, and export payload helpers let host apps reuse saved display state while keeping business queries and file generation in the host app.
- Bundled Stimulus, copied/package entrypoints, install/demo generators, and package verification support both default `stimulus-rails` and custom bundler integration paths.
- Focused user and maintainer documentation now covers quick start, production integration, support, accessibility, demo/sandbox/manual QA, release checks, Product Profile, and assisted-maintenance guardrails.

### Added

- Initial table preference persistence model and Rails engine structure.
- Owner-specific table preference records with configurable owner model and owner foreign key.
- Scoped preset support for owner, shared, role, and organization presets.
- Default preset resolution across owner, role, organization, and shared scopes.
- JSON API for listing, loading, creating, updating, and deleting presets.
- Rails controller helpers for resolving saved settings and converting saved filter/sort state into host app params.
- Rails controller params helpers accept `fallback:` settings so screens can apply default filter/sort params only when no saved preference is resolved.
- Plain controller params adapter for existing `search(params)` / `order_by(params[:sort])` style controllers.
- Ransack params adapter.
- Hidden fields helper for submitting saved filter/sort params through existing search forms.
- Export payload helper for host app CSV, Excel, or report generation.
- Column definition helper with labels, locale lookup, visibility, order, width, truncation, filters, sorting, fixed/pinned metadata, groups, ignored columns, optional `export_key` value-extraction metadata, and manual-column `editor:` metadata for renderer registry lookup.
- Resource table helpers for convention-first Active Record column inference, table profile overrides, optional tree table rendering, and additive table semantics.
- Resource table helpers can pass table HTML options such as `id`, `class`, `data`, and `aria` through to the rendered table while preserving gem-owned controller data attributes.
- Resource table helpers support opt-in captions through `caption:` and keep the caption contract separate from table HTML options.
- Resource table helpers support `render_editor: false` so host apps can render the generated editor separately while keeping the default editor-plus-table behavior unchanged.
- Table and resource table helpers support an opt-in scroll wrapper so host apps can wrap generated tables in the bundled horizontal scroll container class without changing table semantics.
- Table profiles can add virtual or computed columns, including formatter-backed values that are not inferred from the Active Record model.
- Renderer registries for mapping filter and editor metadata to host-app helper libraries such as Rails Fields Kit.
- Column group helper for host app grouped table headers and grouped export headers.
- Settings normalizer for current and legacy `ColumnAdjustment`-style settings payloads.
- Bundled Stimulus controller for applying column visibility, order, width, truncation, filters, sorts, header drag reorder, resize handles, pinned column hooks, and preset editing behavior.
- Copy-based JavaScript, stylesheet, view, and install generators.
- Optional `--with-demo` install generator mode for local browser verification.
- Optional `--with-demo-route` install generator mode for copying the demo screen and adding its route in one explicit opt-in step.
- Generated demo verification includes owner, role, organization, export payload preview, existing search form hidden fields preview, preview evidence copy controls, fixed/grouped column, async failure recovery, and demo-state reset checks.
- Optional `--skip-javascript` and `--skip-stylesheets` install generator modes.
- Legacy `ColumnAdjustment` import rake task.

- TypeScript lifecycle event detail helper declarations for mapping `rails-table-preferences:*` event names to success or error detail shapes from the package root.
- Pull request template guidance for automated verification, manual QA, UI/visual evidence, representative surfaces, focused viewport/state checks, and browser-capture handoff.
- GitHub Actions CI for Ruby specs, JavaScript syntax, CI workflow permission policy, gem build, and package verification, plus representative pull-request Rails compatibility lanes for Rails 7.0, Rails 7.1, Rails 7.2, and Rails 8.0.
- Package verification now guards representative core runtime files used by resource tables, adapters, formatters, registries, and helpers.
- Package verification now checks the packaged `package.json` top-level `types` target and reports it as `package.json#types` when missing.

### Changed

- The initial release target now includes the former v0.2 advanced preference distribution and table layout features.
- README roadmap and current scope were updated to reflect the expanded v0.1 scope.
- Generated migrations use nullable owner references and `scope_type` / `scope_key` to support owner, shared, role, and organization presets.
- The bundled JavaScript controller treats non-owner presets as read-only in the normal editor path and falls back to creating an owner preset when saving edits.
- Preset list loading failure copy now explains the current-name-only fallback and asks users to check the connection and reload before retrying the editor flow.
- The package entrypoint controller now reports Show all columns and Hide all columns bulk actions through the existing editor status region, including the all-hidden recovery path.
- Resource table all-columns-hidden empty state copy now points users to the table preferences editor's Show all columns / 全列表示 recovery action instead of reading like a generic empty table.
- Resource table `except:` filtering now treats a belongs_to foreign key exclusion, such as `customer_id`, as excluding the companion association convenience column too, while association-name exclusions still leave the raw foreign key attribute available.
- Select filter option search copy now separates the label from the placeholder so the field names the action and the placeholder describes searching option names.
- The package entrypoint controller adds a lightweight preset selector search for larger preset collections while keeping the native select, scope grouping, and preset payload semantics unchanged.
- Saved-preset search no-results copy now describes matches as load candidates so users do not confuse the selector search with the save target or current preset name input.
- The package entrypoint controller now shows a saved-preset search clear button while a preset search query is active, restoring all preset options without calling the saved preset API.
- The package entrypoint preset selector now marks default presets with `（既定）` instead of a bare `*` while preserving scope labels, option order, option values, preset identity data, and save/load/delete behavior.
- Preset selector hint copy now explains the `[shared]` / `[role]` / `[organization]` scope markers and `（既定）` default marker near the selector without changing option resolver behavior.
- The generated demo verification panels now use Japanese sample-screen wording around hidden-field evidence, export payload evidence, owner/scope context, reset, and async-failure checks while preserving the same demo behavior and technical boundary cues.
- The package entrypoint filter button active summary now shows `{ value:, label: }` select option labels when a saved value matches a known option, while unknown values still fall back to the raw saved value.
- The package entrypoint editor now exposes a separate dirty-state helper for unsaved changes while leaving async operation messages in the existing status region.
- Datetime and time filters in the package entrypoint render native browser inputs and pass `min`, `max`, and `step` metadata as browser attributes without changing saved filter values or query semantics.
- Column resize drag handling now uses Pointer Events for mouse, touch, pen, and `pointercancel` cleanup while keeping double-click auto-fit on its separate path.
- The Ransack adapter can read normalized column metadata so `filter: { param: ... }` and `sort_param:` override the saved column key before params are handed to the host app.
- The default development Gemfile now pins Rails 8.0.x to match the current representative pull-request compatibility matrix.
- The package verification path now resolves documented package root and controller export targets, then checks their packaged JavaScript relative import/export references.
- Package verification documentation now records `docs/editor_reorder_accessibility.md` as a required packaged docs entrance while keeping `docs/preset_name_save_boundary.md` outside `REQUIRED_PATHS` until it is intentionally promoted.
- Documentation now states the bundled sort UI single-sort boundary and leaves multi-sort composition to host apps.
- Filter adapter documentation now distinguishes ordered neutral `sorts` arrays that Ransack or host-owned adapters can preserve from plain controller params that intentionally reduce to the first valid sort for existing `order_by(params[:sort])` compatibility.
- Documentation now keeps richer filter widgets, date pickers, autocomplete, and external helper widgets as host-app-owned renderer or custom-partial responsibilities instead of bundled filter UI dependencies.
- Export integration documentation now clarifies that spreadsheet formula-like value neutralization belongs to the host app exporter or serializer, not to `export_keys`, `column_keys`, or `headers` metadata.
- Production integration guidance now calls out association preloading when resource table formatters read related records, including quick host-app smoke checks for query logs or existing N+1 guards.
- Resource table formatter docs and specs now make formatter exceptions a host-app formatter responsibility and keep that separate from the default no-formatter fallback.
- Pull request template guidance now has a single canonical `.github/pull_request_template.md` source that keeps manual QA, UI/visual evidence, compatibility, and risk sections together.

### Fixed

- Generator task loading works when the gem is used from a host Rails app.
- Generated migration index names avoid database identifier length issues.
- Rails 7.0 / Ruby 3.1 pull-request compatibility checks avoid `i18n` 1.15.x because that dependency line requires Fiber storage APIs unavailable on Ruby 3.1.
- Engine route names avoid duplicate route name conflicts in the test app.
- Private `current_user` methods are supported.
- Saved filter/sort state survives editor apply operations.
- TypeScript lifecycle action declarations now include the package-entrypoint clear-filters-and-sorts success action, matching the already documented applied event detail.
- Current column metadata overrides stale saved metadata for labels, filters, sortable state, and pinned state.
- Ignored columns are filtered out of editor payloads and saved settings.
- Boolean `false` filter values are preserved through hidden-field and controller-params round trips while `nil`, empty strings, and blank array items remain omitted.
- Saved column numeric settings now drop non-positive or malformed `width`, `truncate`, and `order` values while preserving positive numeric values and numeric strings.
- The package entrypoint controller restores the preset selector to the applied preset after a failed preset load instead of leaving the failed selection visible.
- Select filter option search no longer shows the no-results message when the current selected option is the only match, while still preserving selected options as visible context for non-matching queries.
- The install generator now rejects custom owner foreign keys that do not end with `_id`, avoiding generated reference migrations and table preference indexes that disagree with the configured owner column.
