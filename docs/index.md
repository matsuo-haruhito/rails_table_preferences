# Rails Table Preferences documentation

This directory contains focused documentation for Rails Table Preferences.

## Start here

### Choose your first path

Use this short map before the full catalog when you are opening the docs for the first time.

- New install or smallest working UI: start with [Quick start](quick_start.md), then use [Install path options](install_paths.md) if the host app uses Vite, skipped copied assets, or demo generator options.
- Japanese business-app orientation: start with [日本語 quick start](quick_start_ja.md), then follow its links to the English source-of-truth guides for detailed steps.
- Browser preview before a real host-app screen: generate the [Demo screen](demo.md), then use [Sandbox Rails app verification](sandbox.md) if you want a clean end-to-end install check.
- Convention-first Active Record table: start with [Resource table adapters](resource_tables.md), then move to the [Production integration checklist](production_integration_checklist.md) for real index-screen owner, route, query, layout, and export checks.
- Existing custom or hand-written table: use [Quick start](quick_start.md) for the minimum editor/table wiring and [Decision guide](decision_guide.md) when choosing helpers, hidden fields, controller params, exports, or customization paths.
- Real host-app screen already wired but failing: use [Production troubleshooting notes](production_troubleshooting.md) before changing implementation, especially for auth redirects, CSRF, owner lookup, stable `table_key`, or preset persistence issues.
- Release or package-readiness review: use [Release checklist](release_checklist.md), [Package verification](package_verification.md), and [Manual QA checklist](manual_qa.md) after the integration path is working.

## Public surface source-of-truth family

Rails Table Preferences keeps the first public-surface source of truth in the existing docs and package verification family rather than a dedicated manifest file.

- JavaScript package imports, TypeScript snapshot helper types, and the copied-controller boundary are defined in [JavaScript entrypoints](javascript_entrypoints.md) and [TypeScript settings snapshot declarations](typescript_settings_snapshots.md), then checked by package metadata, entrypoint smoke specs, JavaScript syntax checks, and package verification.
- Helper options, rendered table/editor responsibilities, filter/sort metadata, scoped presets, export payloads, and resource-table adapters are defined in the focused guides linked above instead of being mirrored into README.
- Generator options, copied assets, package contents, and release evidence are guarded by [Install path options](install_paths.md), [Release checklist](release_checklist.md), and [Package verification](package_verification.md).
- README remains the newcomer-facing entry point. This docs index remains the detailed map. Package verification decides which docs and runtime files must ship in the gem.

Do not add a TreeView-style public API manifest as the default first response to drift. Consider one only when a surface becomes too large for the focused guide plus package/spec checks to keep clear, such as a growing helper option inventory, many lifecycle event detail keys, or additional package-root JavaScript exports.

## Recommended integration order

Use this as a navigation map after choosing a starting path above. The first group gets a new reader to a working screen; later groups are follow-up checks for table behavior, data flow, and release readiness.

### First working screen

1. Install the gem and run the generated migration.
2. Use the production integration checklist when moving from the quick start or demo screen to a real host-app index screen.
3. Mount the engine if you use the bundled JSON API.
4. Confirm the Stimulus controller registration path for the host app. Use the default manifest for `stimulus-rails`, or the package entrypoint for Vite / `app/frontend` apps.
5. For convention-first tables, try `resource_table_for @records` and review [Resource table adapters](resource_tables.md).
6. For manually controlled tables, define table columns with `table_preferences_column`.
7. Render `table_preferences_editor` and `table_preferences_table_tag`.
8. Optionally generate the demo screen with `--with-demo`, or `--with-demo-route` when the route should be added at the same time, after confirming the configured current-owner method returns a persisted owner record.

### Adapt the table surface

1. If the inferred resource table only needs light cell styling, use [Resource table cell hooks](resource_table_cell_hooks.md) before copying the default partial.
2. If the inferred resource table should render filter inputs or cell editors through a form-helper library, use the renderer registry context examples from [Resource table adapters](resource_tables.md) before copying a custom partial.
3. If a hand-written table column needs cell editor metadata, use [Manual column editor metadata](manual_column_editor_metadata.md) to keep renderer lookup separate from host-owned form submission and persistence.
4. When a hand-written table needs a dedicated horizontal scroller, use [Manual table scroll wrappers](manual_table_scroll_wrappers.md) to keep table attributes and wrapper attributes separate.
5. Use `html_options:` from [Editor root HTML options](editor_root_options.md) when the bundled editor root needs host-app placement attributes without copying the partial.
6. When `render_editor: false` moves a resource table editor into a toolbar, drawer, tab, sidebar, or separate partial, use the [Resource table editor placement checklist](render_editor_placement_manual_qa.md) to record placement evidence without changing the helper contract.
7. Add `filter:` and `sortable: true` metadata where needed.
8. For static select filters with longer option lists, review the [Select filter option search threshold](select_filter_option_search_threshold.md) before changing root values or treating option search as a remote/async search feature.
9. For datetime or time filter metadata, use [Datetime and time filter browser attributes](datetime_time_filter_attributes.md) to check native input attributes without moving validation or query semantics out of the host app.
10. Use [Filter panel viewport boundary](filter_panel_viewport_boundary.md) when planning bottom-edge panel behavior or reviewing whether future runtime changes need browser-capable evidence.
11. Choose `overflow:` / `default_overflow:` values when text should ellipsize, clip, wrap, or stay single-line.
12. Tune [resize and auto-fit root values](resize_auto_fit.md) only when dense headers, custom scroll containers, or host-app CSS make the defaults hard to use.
13. Use `fixed:` / `pinned:` and `group:` metadata only when the table needs fixed columns or grouped headers/exports.
14. Use the decision guide when choosing between controller params, hidden fields, Ransack, ignored columns, scoped presets, exports, and customization options.
15. Review the accessibility baseline for screens with custom styling or stricter keyboard requirements.
16. When forced-colors or high-contrast evidence is needed, use the forced-colors manual QA note to keep browser-capable checks scoped to the relevant states.
17. Review [Bundled editor i18n keys](editor_i18n.md) before copying ERB or JavaScript for wording-only changes.
18. Review non-goals before adding behavior that looks like a query builder, export generator, admin framework, heavy browser test stack, or complex sticky layout engine.

### Wire data, presets, and exports

1. Configure `scope_context_method` only if shared, role, or organization presets are needed.
2. Use `rails_table_preference_params` or `rails_table_preference_merged_params` in controllers.
3. Use `rails_table_preference_export_payload` when CSV/Excel/report exports should follow saved column settings.
4. Use `table_preferences_hidden_fields` when saved filter/sort params should be submitted through an existing search form.
5. For package-entrypoint lifecycle event listeners, use [TypeScript settings snapshot declarations](typescript_settings_snapshots.md) when the host app wants compile-time helpers for `event.detail.settings`.
6. Review [Hidden fields pagination evidence](hidden_fields_pagination_evidence.md) when the existing search form can also submit an old `page` param.

### Verify before release or user handoff

1. Verify the feature in a sandbox Rails app.
2. Review [Support matrix](support_matrix.md) when the host app's Ruby/Rails version is outside the currently documented representative CI matrix.
3. Run the manual QA checklist before asking real users to try the feature.
4. Use the forced-colors manual QA note when the handoff needs high-contrast evidence for active filters, sorted headers, resize handles, filter panels, or pinned/fixed cells.
5. Before release, run the release checklist and package verification guide.

## Responsibility boundary

Rails Table Preferences owns:

- table display preference UI
- column visibility, order, width, and truncation settings
- fixed/pinned column metadata and CSS hooks
- column group metadata
- owner, shared, role, and organization scoped presets
- saved presets and default presets
- filter/sort UI state
- adapter params for host applications or search gems
- resource table column inference and profile overrides when the helper path is used
- resource table body-cell metadata hooks for light host-app styling
- renderer registry lookup for filter/editor metadata when a host app registers renderers
- export column payloads derived from saved display preferences
- baseline accessibility hooks for generated controls

Host applications own:

- actual database search execution
- authorization
- joins and association logic
- business-specific query behavior
- semantic page/table structure around the generated controls
- sticky column offset and scroll-container polish for complex layouts
- grouped table header markup
- cell styling rules, badges, and complex custom table presentation
- renderer registrations and concrete form-helper HTML for filter/editor metadata
- CSV, Excel, and report file generation
- administration UI for shared, role, or organization presets
- final styling and UI polish
