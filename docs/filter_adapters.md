# Filter adapters

Rails Table Preferences may provide Excel-like filter UI in a future version, but it should not become a general-purpose query builder.

The preferred boundary is:

- Rails Table Preferences owns filter UI state, saved filter conditions, saved sorts, presets, and normalized params.
- Host applications or existing gems own ActiveRecord query execution, joins, authorization, database-specific behavior, and business rules.

This lets the gem work alongside tools such as Ransack, Datagrid, Filterrific, or a host application's own search objects.

## Neutral filter format

Saved settings should remain gem-neutral:

```json
{
  "columns": [
    {
      "key": "customer_name",
      "visible": true,
      "order": 30,
      "width": 240,
      "truncate": 20
    }
  ],
  "filters": {
    "customer_name": {
      "operator": "contains",
      "value": "山田"
    },
    "status": {
      "operator": "in",
      "values": ["未出荷", "出荷済"]
    },
    "delivery_date": {
      "operator": "between",
      "from": "2026-01-01",
      "to": "2026-01-31"
    }
  },
  "sorts": [
    {
      "key": "delivery_date",
      "direction": "desc"
    }
  ]
}
```

The saved format should not use Ransack predicates, Datagrid filter names, Filterrific scope names, or application-specific SQL concepts directly.

## Ransack adapter

The initial adapter is a pure params converter. It does not require Ransack as a gem dependency and does not execute searches itself.

```ruby
filters = {
  customer_name: { operator: :contains, value: "山田" },
  status: { operator: :in, values: ["未出荷", "出荷済"] },
  delivery_date: { operator: :between, from: "2026-01-01", to: "2026-01-31" }
}

sorts = [
  { key: :delivery_date, direction: :desc }
]

ransack_params = RailsTablePreferences::Adapters::Ransack.to_params(
  filters: filters,
  sorts: sorts
)

# => {
#   "customer_name_cont" => "山田",
#   "status_in" => ["未出荷", "出荷済"],
#   "delivery_date_gteq" => "2026-01-01",
#   "delivery_date_lteq" => "2026-01-31",
#   "s" => ["delivery_date desc"]
# }

@q = Order.ransack(ransack_params)
@orders = @q.result
```

`between` maps to lower and upper Ransack predicates instead of a single predicate. A `from` value becomes `<field>_gteq`, a `to` value becomes `<field>_lteq`, and blank bounds are omitted. The adapter does not parse dates, apply time zones, or execute the query.

When the displayed column key differs from the Ransack field, pass normalized columns or use `table_preferences_params(adapter: :ransack)`. The adapter reads existing column metadata: `filter: { param: ... }` overrides the filter field before the predicate is appended, and `sort_param:` overrides the sort field. Without those metadata keys, the saved column key is used unchanged.

```ruby
columns = [
  table_preferences_column(
    :customer_id,
    filter: { type: :text, param: :customer_name },
    sort_param: :customer_name
  )
]

settings = {
  filters: { customer_id: { operator: :contains, value: "山田" } },
  sorts: [{ key: :customer_id, direction: :asc }]
}

ransack_params = table_preferences_params(
  settings: settings,
  columns: columns,
  adapter: :ransack
)

# => {
#   "customer_name_cont" => "山田",
#   "s" => ["customer_name asc"]
# }
```

Supported operator mapping:

| Neutral operator | Ransack predicate |
| --- | --- |
| `contains` | `cont` |
| `not_contains` | `not_cont` |
| `equals` | `eq` |
| `not_equals` | `not_eq` |
| `starts_with` | `start` |
| `ends_with` | `end` |
| `in` | `in` |
| `not_in` | `not_in` |
| `gt` | `gt` |
| `gteq` | `gteq` |
| `lt` | `lt` |
| `lteq` | `lteq` |
| `between` | `gteq` for `from`, `lteq` for `to` |
| `blank` | `blank` |
| `present` | `present` |
| `true` | `true` |
| `false` | `false` |

## Datagrid and Filterrific host adapters

Datagrid and Filterrific are not current built-in adapter classes. Treat them as host-application adapter examples unless a future feature explicitly adds gem-owned helpers.

That means Rails Table Preferences can still supply the neutral `filters` and `sorts` payload, but the host application should translate that payload into the Datagrid or Filterrific API it already trusts.

A small host-owned adapter can live near the controller, query object, or table profile:

```ruby
class OrderDatagridParams
  def self.call(filters:, sorts: [])
    {
      customer_name: filters.dig("customer_name", "value"),
      statuses: filters.dig("status", "values"),
      order: sorts.map { |sort| "#{sort["key"]} #{sort["direction"]}" }
    }.compact
  end
end

settings = rails_table_preference_settings(table_key: :orders)
filters = settings.fetch("filters", {})
sorts = settings.fetch("sorts", [])

grid = OrdersGrid.new(OrderDatagridParams.call(filters: filters, sorts: sorts))
```

For Filterrific, keep the same boundary: map only the neutral UI state into existing allowed params or scopes, then let the host app apply its normal authorization and query rules.

```ruby
class OrderFilterrificParams
  def self.call(filters:, sorts: [])
    first_sort = sorts.first

    {
      search_query: filters.dig("customer_name", "value"),
      with_status: filters.dig("status", "values"),
      sorted_by: first_sort && "#{first_sort["key"]}_#{first_sort["direction"]}"
    }.compact
  end
end

filterrific = initialize_filterrific(
  Order,
  OrderFilterrificParams.call(filters: filters, sorts: sorts),
  persistence_id: false
)
```

Keep the adapter intentionally boring:

- map only fields the current screen already allows
- reject or ignore unknown keys instead of inferring joins
- keep authorization and business scopes in the host app
- keep Datagrid classes, Filterrific configurations, and custom search objects owned by the host app
- add a project-local adapter first when the mapping is application-specific

## Non-goals

Rails Table Preferences should not become:

- a generic ActiveRecord query builder
- a Ransack replacement
- a Datagrid replacement
- a Filterrific replacement
- a DataTables replacement
- an automatic join inference system
- an authorization system

The gem's role is to provide a good table preference UX and normalized saved UI state that can be handed to existing search layers.
